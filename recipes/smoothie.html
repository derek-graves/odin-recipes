    <h1>Everyday Smoothie</h1>
      <img src="../img/smoothie.jpg" alt = "The Everyday Smoothie">
    <h2>Descrtiption</h2>
      <p>This is a jack-of-all-trades smoothie. It can be eaten as a meal--breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It can be eaten for post-workout nutrition and replenishment. It can even be eaten as a snack, if made in smaller quantities. Use it to best suit your needs. I eat it most often as a post-workout 'meal' or as a late breakfast/brunch on the weekends</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 banana</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh spinach, packed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups skim milk (substitute soy milk for dairy-free, or any other alt milk with good protein content)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (4 tbsp) peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen blueberries</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen strawberries</li>
        <li>Ice, to preference</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The first thing you need is a blender. I love a Vitamix, and they produce awesome smoothies. They're also quite expensive and not strictly necessary. Any working blender will do. Though you'll get better results with a Vitamix.</li>
        <li>Place the ingredients into the blender in the following order:
          <ol>
            <li>banana</li>
            <li>spinach</li>
            <li>skim milk</li>
            <li>peanut butter</li>
            <li>frozen berries and ice (if using)</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Blend on a low speed (3 works well) for 10 seconds</li>
        <li>Increase the speed to 8 and blend for an additional 45 seconds</li> 
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
